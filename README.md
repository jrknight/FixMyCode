# FixMyCode
FixMyCode - An app to help you make apps!


This project was started to assist in teaching the computer science students in Washoe County School District. We understand the struggles that computer science teachers face debugging students code. That's where FixMyCode comes in! 

FixMyCode lets students submit their code to teacher-sponsered helpers, allowing them to get timely help with their coding struggles.
